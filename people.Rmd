        <h2>[Dr. Tyler Marghetis](https://www.tylermarghetis.com/)</h2>
        <p>I'm an Assistant Professor of [Cognitive & Information Sciences](https://cogsci.ucmerced.edu) at the [University of California, Merced](https://www.ucmerced.edu/). I am also an [Omidyar Complexity Fellow](https://www.santafe.edu/people/profile/tyler-marghetis) at the [Santa Fe Institute](https://www.santafe.edu/).
After completing my PhD in [cognitive science](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/) at the University of California, San Diego (with [Rafael Núñez](https://cogsci.ucsd.edu/people/faculty/rafael-nunez.html)), I did postdoctoral research at Indiana University, Bloomington, mentored by [Robert Goldstone](https://psych.indiana.edu/directory/faculty/goldstone-robert.html) and [David Landy](https://davidlandy.net/).</p>

    <figcaption style="padding-top:60px" style="padding-left:0px">
        <p>Before I found my calling as a scientist, I lived in Canada,
where I was a child detective, a professional magician, 
and a national team wrestler and alternate for the 2008 Olympics.</p>
<p>(This image illustrates how, in sport as in science, using your head can save the day.)</p>
When I'm not tracing the limits of human imagination, you'll find me biking around town, cooking feasts for chosen family, and working toward a more just society. (Though perhaps not all at once.)</p>

    <figcaption>
        <h2>Chanuwas Aswamenakul</h2>
        <p>I’m a PhD student in the Marghetis lab and the Smaldino lab. I study politics as a multi-level complex collective decision-making system that can be shaped by formal institutions, culture, and interpersonal dynamics and how different political systems affect economic outcome and human behaviors.</p>
        <p>In my free time, I enjoy gaming, watching anime, cooking, sightseeing, and photography.</p>

        <h2>Leo Niehorster-Cook</h2>
        <p>I'm a PhD student in the Marghetis Lab, starting Fall of 2022. I study how interactions between individual minds give rise to large-scale social phenomena such as collective action, group conflict, and communication systems, with a focus on formal modeling techniques.</p>
        <p>Outside the lab, I'm a community organizer and an avid fan of science fiction.</p>

        <h2>Soran Malaie</h2>
        <p>I am a second-year PhD student in the Cognitive Science Department at UC Merced. My research focuses on understanding creativity as a form of spatial foraging behavior, situated within the context of embodied cognition. My work draws inspiration from Merleau-Ponty's phenomenology and James Gibson’s Ecological Psychology.</p>
        <p>Outside the lab, my Kurdish heritage has led me to closely follow political conflicts, notably those in the Middle East, where I fervently support marginalized minority groups in their pursuit of justice and empowerment.</p>

        <h2>Shervin Nosrati</h2>
        <p>I am a first year PhD student in the Marghetis Lab. I research metaphor, gesture, and all things space and time. I am particularly interested in how we use our understanding of space to structure abstract conceptualization.</p>
        <p>In my spare time, I am making copious amounts of pasta and watching old samurai movies with my cat Data.</p>

        <h2>Benjamin Robbins</h2>
        <p>Hi everyone! I’m a current researcher in the Marghetis Lab working on the creation of a paper examining the ways that disability and difference can lead to creative breakthroughs through conceptual analysis and a literature review. My research interests vary, though the main focus of my research include Mental Health, Emotion, and Judgement and its interactions with Decision-Making. These interests have been passions of mine for as long as I can remember, and I’m always looking to learn as much as I can on the subject.</p>
        <p>Outside of the lab, other interests and hobbies of mine include baseball, music, physical exercise, and cooking!</p>

        <h2>Alyssa Ortega</h2>
        <p>I am the full time joint manager of Marghetis and [LInC lab](https://linclab0.github.io/) at the University of California, Merced,  where I recently graduated with a B.A. in Psychology & Cognitive Science. While my primary interest lies in exploring the impact of gesture as a promoter of learning and discovery, my role as a lab manager has given me the opportunity to be involved in a wide array of projects. I currently utilize a variety of methods such as behavioral experimentation, EEG, and naturalistic observation. </p>
        <p>Recently, my free time has been dedicated to working on graduate school applications but I also enjoy going for runs to decompress after a long day. </p>
