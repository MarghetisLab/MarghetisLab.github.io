<div class="header">
  <p>Our lab celebrates curiosity, encourages collaboration, and cultivates both intellectual playfulness and rigor.<br>
We work to create an environment that is inclusive and anti-racist â€” a lab where people can thrive, regardless of background, identity, or ability. That includes Black, Indigenous, and People of Color, first-generation college students, women, LGBTQ+ folk, people with disabilities, people from any country and with any immigration status, people belonging to groups that have been historically underrepresented in academia or cognitive science, and everybody else. </p>
